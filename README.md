# Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:
* Use schema.sql to create all tables.
* Use data.sql to populate tables with sample data.
* Check queries.sql for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
